# [Tinkers' Wood](https://slimeknights.github.io/projects/#tinkers-wood)

Tinkers' Wood is an addon for [Tinkers' Construct](https://slimeknights.github.io/projects/#tinkers-construct) adding wood material variants to Tinkers' Construct tools. This used to be a feature of the base mod, but was moved to an addon to both reduce file size and to add the possibility of supporting additional modded woods in the future.

This mod is a lowcode mod, as it only requires resource pack and datapack features to add the variants.

## Installing

To use this mod, you need at least [Tinkers' Construct](https://slimeknights.github.io/projects/#tinkers-construct) build 3.9.3, which allows testing like any Java mod.

Its not required, but it makes development a lot easier to install [Json Things](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/json-things), as their thingpack folder is far easier to use than vanilla datapacks.
